Structure-aware attacks on GNNs

This repository implements global black-box adversarial attacks on the node classification task with graph neural networks.
The attacks have only access to the adjacency matrix and not the nodes feature vectors.
These attacks are currenlty based on the knowledge of the degree distribution and community structure.
